<Layout title="Screen Reader Only" description="Use when content has to be available to assistive technology, but otherwise hidden.">

## Usage guidance

`ScreenReaderOnly` provides a text for assistive technologies, such as screen readers, that is visually hidden. Think of the opposite of the `aria-hidden` attribute.

Keep in mind that many HTML markup elements, such as `button`, already have meaning to assistive technologies. In such cases use with caution to override defaults.

## Best practices

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - use sparingly, as many markup elements already have meaning to screen readers
    - use to provide extra context, when regular markup is not enough
    - add hints, which makes sense when used with screen readers

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use to hide interactive content

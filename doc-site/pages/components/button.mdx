## Best Practices

### General

The button comes in four different variants: `primary`, `secondary`, `plain`, `destructive`, and `upgrade`.

**Primary** button ideally is used only once on a page to display the most important action we want the user to take. Usually, the default size is sufficient, but to draw more attention `large` size can be used. Use `small` size sparingly - in the tight spaces or more complex user interfaces.

**Secondary** button can be used multiple times on a page, in a combination with primary or plain buttons to create the actions hierarchy.

**Plain** button should be used for supportive, less important actions.

**Destructive** button expresses the actions user can't take back.

**Upgrade** button should be used only in context of upgrading to different DataCamp's pricing plan.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - when a long explanation is needed, add it above or below the button as a text
    - in general use default size, and other sizes as an exception
    - use `inverted` button on a dark background
    - separate multiple buttons placed next to each other by `spacing.small` from [design tokens](/foundation/design-tokens)

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use a lot of buttons&mdash;too many calls to action cause user's confusion
    - use multiple `primary` buttons when you have many actions at once
    - use `primary` button to manipulate user
    - use `upgrade` button for actions other than upgrading to different plan

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### Label

A label should be short, clear, and actionable, such as _Get Certified Now_.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - should lead with a strong verb that encourages action
    - for common actions such as _Done_ or _Close_ it is enough to provide verb only
    - capitalize the first letter of each word

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - provide long explanations as a button label
    - use unnecessary words, such as _a_, _an_, _the_ in a label

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### Button with Icon

Icons add additional context and make buttons easier to scan. Button with icon also draws more attention.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - it's great idea to use an icon, when button needs to draw more attention to the action
    - most of the time default size [icon](/components/icon) from Waffles is preffered, regardless of the button
    size
    - always provide `aria-label` with icon-only button to make sure it's accessible
    - usually `rightIcon` shoud be directional, such as `ChevronRight` Waffles [icon](/components/icon)

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - overuse button with icon
    - provide both `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` at once&mdash;only allowed in rare circumstances
    - provide both button label and `aria-label`&mdash;do it only in rare cases when additional information must be provided for users with disabilities
    - for icon-only button specify `aria-label` for both button and icon components

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### Button vs Link

For navigational actions that appear within or directly following a sentence, use the [Link](/components/link) component.

For standalone navigational actions, it is fine to use button&mdash;just set component type to `a` via `as` prop. Custom components, such as react router `Link` could be passed that way as well.

## Best practices

### General

The `Button` comes in four different variants: `primary`, `secondary`, `plain`, `destructive`, and `upgrade`.

- `primary` variant is ideally used only once on a page to display the most important action we want the user to take. Usually, the default size is sufficient, but to draw more attention `large` size can be used. Use `small` size sparingly—in tight spaces or more complex user interfaces.

- `secondary` variant can be used multiple times on a page, in a combination with a primary or plain `Button` to create an action hierarchy.

- `plain` variant should be used for supportive, less important actions.

- `destructive` variant expresses an action a user can't take back.

- `upgrade` variant should be used only in context of upgrading to different DataCamp's pricing plan.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - when a long explanation is needed, add it above or below the button as a text
    - in general use the default size, and other sizes as an exception
    - use an `inverted` Button on a dark background
    - separate multiple buttons placed next to each other by `tokens.spacing.small` from [Design Tokens](/foundation/design-tokens)

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use a lot of buttons&mdash;too many calls to action cause users confusion
    - use multiple `primary` Buttons when you have many actions at once
    - use `primary` Button to manipulate user
    - use `upgrade` button for actions other than upgrading to different plan

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### Label

A label should be short, clear, and actionable, such as _Get Certified Now_. The text content of a `Button` is automatically _Title Cased_.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - should lead with a strong verb that encourages action
    - for common actions such as _Done_ or _Close_, it is enough to provide the verb only

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use an empty string as content&mdash;use self-closing syntax tags instead
    - provide long explanations as a Button label
    - use unnecessary words, such as _a_, _an_, _the_ in a label

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### Button with an Icon

Icons add additional context and make buttons easier to scan. A button with an icon also draws more attention.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - it's a great idea to use an [Icon](/components/icon), when a button needs to draw more attention to the action
    - most of the time default size [Icon](/components/icon) from Waffles is preferred, regardless of the Button
    size
    - always provide `aria-label` with an icon-only Button to make sure it's accessible
    - usually `rightIcon` should be directional, such as `ChevronRight` Waffles [Icon](/components/icon)

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - overuse Buttons with icon
    - provide both `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` at once&mdash;only allowed in rare circumstances
    - provide both Button label and `aria-label`&mdash;do it only in rare cases when additional information must be provided for accessibility
    - for an icon-only button, provide `aria-label` for both `Button` and [Icon](/components/icon) components

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### Button vs Link

For navigational actions that appear within or directly following a sentence, use the [Link](/components/link) component.

For standalone navigational actions, it is fine to use `Button`&mdash;just set component type to `a` via `as` prop. Custom components, such as react router `Link` could be passed that way as well.

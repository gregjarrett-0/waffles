<Layout title="Button" description="A button triggers an event or action. It lets users know what will happen next. Use actionable copy, don’t be vague.">

## Usage guidelines

The `Button` comes in four different variants: `primary`, `secondary`, `plain`, `destructive`, and `upgrade`. The provided text content is automatically _Title Cased_ using our [setTitleCase](/helpers/#settitlecase) helper, but can be disabled in rare cases with `disableTitleCase`.

When using multiple `Buttons`, they should be horizontally separated with `tokens.spacing.small` from [Design Tokens](/foundation/design-tokens) and stacked vertically (with the same spacing) where this is not possible.

Additionally, `Buttons` also have an `isLoading` state which disables it and features the [Loader](/components/loader) component. It can be used to show that an action is in process, e.g. submitting a form.

### Variants

#### Primary

- Ideally used only once on a page to display the most important action we want the user to take.
- Usually, the default size is sufficient, but to draw more attention `large` size can be used
- Use `small` size sparingly—in tight spaces or more complex user interfaces
- Primary `Buttons` should be positioned on top or to the right of other `Buttons` in a group

#### Secondary

- Can be used multiple times on a page, in a combination with a `primary` or `plain` `Button` to create an action hierarchy
- Usually associated with an alternative action to a `primary` variant

#### Plain

- Should be used for supportive, less important actions within a hierarchy

#### Destructive

- Expresses an action a user can't take back

#### Upgrade

- Should be used only in context of upgrading to different DataCamp's pricing plan

### Button vs Link

For navigational actions that appear within or directly following a sentence, use the [Link](/components/link) component.

For standalone navigational actions, it is fine to use `Button`&mdash;just set the `as` prop to to `a`. Custom components, such as react router `Link` can be passed that way as well.

## Best practices

#### General

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - when a long explanation is needed, add it above or below the Button as a text
    - in general use the default size, and other sizes as an exception
    - use an `inverted` Button on a dark background
    - show an [Icon](/components/icon) with a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) next to a `disabled` Button, with added context

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use a lot of Buttons&mdash;too many calls to action cause user confusion
    - use multiple `primary` Buttons per area/container
    - use `primary` Button to manipulate user interaction
    - use `upgrade` Button for actions other than upgrading to different plan
    - add a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) to a `disabled` Button

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### Label

A label should be short, clear, and actionable, such as _Get Certified Now_.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - should lead with a strong verb that encourages action
    - for common actions such as _Done_ or _Close_, it is enough to provide the verb only

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use an empty string as content&mdash;use self-closing syntax tags instead
    - provide long explanations as a Button label
    - use unnecessary filler words, such as _a_, _an_, _the_ in a label

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### Button with an Icon

Icons add additional visual context and make buttons easier to scan. A button with an icon also draws more attention.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - use an [Icon](/components/icon), when a Button needs to draw more attention to the action
    - most of the time default size [Icon](/components/icon) from Waffles is preferred, regardless of the Button
    size
    - always provide `aria-label` with an icon-only Button to make sure it's accessible
    - usually `rightIcon` should be directional, such as `ChevronRight` Waffles [Icon](/components/icon)

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - overuse Buttons with icon
    - provide both `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` at once&mdash;only allowed in rare circumstances
    - provide both Button label and `aria-label`&mdash;do it only in rare cases when additional information must be provided for accessibility
    - for an icon-only Button, provide `aria-label` for both Button and [Icon](/components/icon) components

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

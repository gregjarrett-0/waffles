## Best practices

### General

The main purpose of an icon is to clarify the content by providing a visual cue and improve the scannability of the user interface. The icon should _never_ be used to replace a name of a product or feature. Very often icon helps enhance the button's message.

Icons are available in five different sizes: `xlarge`, `large`, `medium`, `small`, and `xsmall`. In general, the default size should be used.

On rare occasions there may be the need to use different sizes:

- use `xsmall` or `small` icon together with smaller text sizes
- use `xlarge` or `large` icon as standalone or decorative element

Icons can also help save screen real-estate in tight user interfaces.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - in general, an icon should be placed near a label or title
    - give the icon a text equivalent if its purpose isn't conveyed in any other way
    - the label should be short and match the meaning of the icon
    - use an icon to draw attention to important action or section of an app

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - overuse icons&mdash;they draw a lot of attention, which quickly results in a user interface that is visually overwhelming and distracting

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>

### Icon is not a Button

An icon is an image only, therefore by default it doesn't have any label or title, and is hidden from assistive technologies, such as screen readers. If for some reason a description for assistive technologies must be provided explicitly use the `aria-label` attribute.

An icon usally is used together with a button. In that case use [Button](/components/button) component and provided icon via `icon`, `iconLeft` or `iconRight` props. In similar fashion, it could enhance [Link](/components/link) component.

  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - be free to use the icon-only button for universally understood actions, like a `Trash` icon representing deletion
    - for icon-only Waffles button provide icon via `icon` prop and specify the accessible description with `aria-label` attribute
    - to enhance Waffles button or link with an icon provide it via `iconLeft` or `iconRight` prop
    - in general use default icon size with a button
    - in rare cases it is allowed to use `large` or `xlarge` size with an icon-only button

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use icons commonly associated with actions, such as `AddCircle` or `Cross`, in places where the user can't interact with them, which can lead to frustration when nothing happens
    - directly provide event handlers such as `onClick`&mdash;use button with icon instead

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>

## Props

### Icon

In addition to `size` prop listed below, icons accept all props regular `SVGElement` would, such as `aria-` and `data-` attributes.

<PropsTable
  metadata={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../../../src/icon/icon-internal')}
/>

## Imports

You can import any existing icon as a separate component. For example to import `AddCircle` icon use:

<Imports module={['AddCircle']} path="@datacamp/waffles/icon" />

</Layout>

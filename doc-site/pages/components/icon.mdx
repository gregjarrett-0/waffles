## Usage guidelines

The main purpose of an `Icon` is to clarify the content by providing a visual cue and improve the scannability of the user interface. They can also help save screen real-estate in tight user interfaces. The `Icon` should _never_ be used to replace a name of a product or feature. An `Icon` can frequently help enhance a [Button's](/components/button) message or action.

`Icons` are available in five different sizes: `xlarge`, `large`, `medium`, `small`, and `xsmall`. In general though, the default size should be used.

On rare occasions there may be a need to use different sizes:

- use `xsmall` or `small` together with smaller text sizes
- use `xlarge` or `large` as standalone or decorative element
- for use cases where a larger than available size is required, use one of the available [Assets](/components/asset)

An `Icon` is an image only, therefore by default it doesn't have any label or title and is hidden from assistive technologies, such as screen readers, by default. If a description for assistive technologies is necessary, use the `aria-label` attribute.

Most `Icons` will inherit their color by default but can also be overwritten on the component level. The exception to this are `Icons` that have `Colored` in their names, such as `GoogleColoredBrand`

## Best practices

### General

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - in most cases, pair an Icon with a label or title
    - provide the Icon with a text equivalent if it's purpose isn't otherwise clear
    - a label should be short and match the meaning of the Icon
    - use an Icon to draw attention to important action or section of an app
    - use an Icon where space is limited
    - stick to commonly used and recognizable Icons for common use cases

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - overuse Icons, as they draw a lot of attention and can be overwhelming and distracting
    - directly provide event handlers such as `onClick`&mdash;use a [Button](/components/button) with an Icon instead
    - use Icons commonly associated with actions, such as `AddCircle` or `Cross`, outside of a [Button](/components/button) or [Link](/components/link)
    - use Icons without labels unless associated with common actions, such as `Search` or `Cross`&mdash;always provide an `aria-label` in these cases
    - describe what the Icon is with `aria-label`&mdash;describe the action instead

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### Icon within a Button

An `Icon` can be used together with a [Button](/components/button). In that case provide an `Icon` via the [Button's](/components/button) `icon`, `iconLeft` or `iconRight` properties. In a similar fashion, it can also enhance the [Link](/components/link) component.

## All available Icons

<AllIconsGrid />

## Examples

<Example title="Sizes" path="icon/sizes">
  <Sizes />
</Example>

<Example title="In a Button" path="icon/in-a-button">
  <InAButton />
</Example>

<Example title="In a Link" path="icon/in-a-link">
  <InALink />
</Example>

## Props

### Icon

In addition to `size` prop listed below, Icons accept all props regular `SVGElement` would, such as `aria-` and `data-` attributes.

<PropsTable
  metadata={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../../../src/icon/icon-internal')}
/>

## Imports

You can import any existing Icon as a separate component. For example to import `AddCircle` Icon use:

<Imports module={['AddCircle']} path="@datacamp/waffles/icon" />

</Layout>

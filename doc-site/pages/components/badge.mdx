## Usage guidance

A `Badge` holds a very small amount of information and should be positioned in close proximity to other components to help draw attention and provide context, e.g. a "NEW" tag for new options in a [Menu](/components/menu).

The content of a `Badge` will always be shown as uppercase and is available in three different sizes: `small`, `medium` and `large`. In most cases, the default value should be used.

The colors of a `Badge` should never be overwritten, as they are chosen for suitable accessibility and brand requirements.

They should **never** be interactive and instead a [Button](/components/button) should be used if interaction is desired.

## Best practices

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - use to give a status update&mdash;such as "NEW"
    - use text that is both succinct and unambiguous
    - use at most two short words as Badge content

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - provide interaction with the Badge component
    - use too many different colored Badges together
    - use a different `size` to surrounding text
    - content should not contain anything besides text

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>

<Layout title="Empty State" description="When an area of a page has no content to show the user.">

## Usage guidance

An `EmptyState` is useful in scenarios where there is a need to show container even when there is no content. They have the benefit of helping the application not feel lifeless or unnecessary, as well as promoting required action in some cases.

An `EmptyState` should replace the content that would show under normal circumstances and should also be clear in telling users what it's for / why they're seeing it.

## Best practices

### General

It is recommended to provide an action for what the user should do next, in order to populate the associated container.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - use when a container has no content or data to show
    - tell the user what the area is and why it's empty in a meaningful way
    - provide an action, where appropriate, as a solution or next step
    - provide a suitable image or illustration, where appropriate

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use as a way of communicating errors
    - use to highlight content&mdash;use [Card](/components/card) instead
    - use vague content such as _"This area is empty"_
    - provide no explanation as to why they are seeing the EmptyState
    - overuse multiple EmptyState components within the same space
    - provide unnecessarily long descriptions

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

### List / List Item

A list can be used within the `EmptyState` component to give a brief overview of options available if there was content shown. This can include reasoning to entice a user in to following the proceeding action.

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - consistent use of one bullet point style

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - mix both icons and normal bullets in one list
    - include long detailed content inside a list item

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>
</BestPractices>

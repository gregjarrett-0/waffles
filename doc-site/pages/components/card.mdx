## Usage guidance

`Card` makes it easier to scan for relevant and _actionable_ information. A clear hierarchy of elements such as text, buttons, and images should be preserved. It can also serve as an entry point into deeper levels of detail or navigation.

Multiple `Cards` can be displayed together in a grid or a vertical list, and separated by `tokens.spacing.medium` gutter.

To make a `Card` stand out more or to emphasize its purpose, provide `Card.HeadstoneItem` (single or multiple) via `headstone` prop. It can contain either [Icons](/components/icon) or [Assets](/components/asset).

In rare occasions, when the `Card` is used to just group content without any actions, the hover drop shadow effect can be disabled with `disableHoverEffect` prop.

It's possible to make the whole `Card` act as an action item&mdash;use `as="a"` (or any other link from the routing library of choice).

### Content

The `Card` container itself is the only required element. Every other element is optional. It holds all card elements, and the size is determined by the space occupied by its content.

For `Card` headline in general use [Heading](/components/heading) of the default `xlarge` size.

For supporting text body use [Paragrpah](/components/paragraph).

For call to action use [Button](/components/button), and follow `Button` best practices.

## Best practices

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - use a heading which makes `Card` purpose very clear
    - prioritize information, so the most important content comes first
    - break complicated flows into multiple sections
    - use only one `primary` call to action (`Button`) per card
    - usually put a call to action at the bottom of a `Card`

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use too many calls to actions
    - use "Click Here" as a call to action label&mdash;it doesn't set up proper expectations of what's next

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>

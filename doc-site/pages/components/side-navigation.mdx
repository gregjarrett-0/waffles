## Usage guidance

`SideNavigation` allows users to orient, and navigate to different sections of applications reliably, and should be used for top-level destinations. It automatically switches between desktop and mobile (drawer) mode, depending on the device's width.

Currently, the active destination should be highlighted by setting `isActive` flag on `SideNavigation.Item` subcomponent.

To make the recently added navigation item stand out more use `isNew` prop on `SideNavigation.Item` subcomponent.

### Build

To keep the underlying side navigation structure _semantically correct_ and _accessible_, please follow these rules:

- besides predefined subcomponents `SideNavigation` and `SideNavigation.Nav` can also contain entirely custom components
- always wrap `SideNavigation.Category` (single or multiple ones) with `SideNavigation.Nav`
- always wrap `SideNavigation.Subcategory` (single or multiple ones) with `SideNavigation.Category`
- always wrap `SideNavigation.Item` (single or multiple ones) with either `SideNavigation.Category` or `SideNavigation.Subcategory`

Bear in mind, that _mobile_ side navigation is automatically displayed below `medium` [breakpoint](/foundation/design-tokens/#all-available-tokens). To keep other related elements in sync use:

- `aboveMedium` [mediaQuery](/components/helpers/#mediaquery)
- conditionally show them based on the result of `isAboveMedium` returned by [useMediaQuery](/components/hooks/#usemediaquery) hook

For detailed real-world example check a [little demo](https://waffles-grid.surge.sh/), and [Side Navigation Workshop](https://github.com/datacamp-engineering/side-nav-workshop) apps.

## Best practices

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - provide a short, and meaningful label for each `SideNavigation.Item`
    - navigation items within each level should be relatively equal in importance

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

- use for single tasks, such as viewing a single course
- show user preferences or settings
- mix icon and non-icon `SideNavigation.Items` within one `SideNavigation.Category`

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>

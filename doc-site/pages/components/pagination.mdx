<Layout title="Pagination" description="A control for navigating through content split into multiple pages.">

## Usage guidance

`Pagination` allows content to be divided into smaller chunks, across multiple pages, whilst managing the current active page. The updating of the `currentPage` should be handled as part of the `onChange` callback.

Users can navigate through the pages by clicking on the individual page buttons or the previous and next buttons. A maximum of seven pages will be shown at one time, with a maximum five being shown on smaller width devices. If the `totalPages` exceeds this maximum visible value, then truncation is displayed on the left and right as the user navigates.

There is an `inverted` property for cases where the `Pagination` component is used on a darker background.

## Accessibility

An `aria-label` must always be provided with context of the `Pagination` (e.g. "Search results pagination").

Furthermore for the best accessibility, `Pagination` should be used with `aria-live` regions to notify users of dynamic content changes. This means that in most cases, a change of `currentPage` should not trigger a full page reload. If content needs to be fetched as part of this update, then it's recommended to use a [Loader](/components/loader) in the meantime.

## Best practices

<BestPractices>
  <BestPractices.Recommended>

    - use alongside dynamic content changes
    - provide an accessible `aria-label` with the context of the pagination
    - use for large or long content that can split up

  </BestPractices.Recommended>
  <BestPractices.Discouraged>

    - use alongside full page reloads for content changes
    - use for short content that should be kept together

  </BestPractices.Discouraged>

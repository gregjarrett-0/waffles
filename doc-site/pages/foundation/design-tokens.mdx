<Layout title="Design Tokens" description="Design tokens are the smallest design system atoms. They are named entities that store visual design attributes, and are crucial to keeping designs consistent. They are used in place of hardcoded values, such as HEX color codes for color or pixel values for spacing.">

## All available Tokens

This is the complete set of official DataCamp design tokens. Ideally, these are the only values you would need to use in the DataCamp project, when creating custom components.

### Colors

Functionally use color to show intent. It's great to have the content not only beautiful but also usable.

For **text** usually use `navy` or `navySubtleTextOnLight` color to achieve the best contrast against light backgrounds, and `white` or `navySubtleTextOnDark` for dark backgrounds. We recommend using subtle for supporting copy, and normal for text heavy content. There are also a few special colors defined to be used for text only, e.g. `redDarkText`. Always take accessibility into account and test text and background color contrast to meet [WCAG 2.1 level AA accessibility requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum). There are various [tools](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) available to do so. Waffles also offers [readableHexColor](/components/helpers/#readablehexcolor) helper, which automatically picks the right readable color.

For **backgrounds** mainly use `white`, `beigeLight`, and on rare occasions `navy`.

For **accessibility** hints, such as focus style, use `blueDark`.

There are [a few helpers](/components/helpers) available in Waffles for advanced colors adjustments. They are very useful for defining mouse over styles, where opacity or lightness of color must be tweaked.

### Sizing

Use for both width and height of the action elements, such as buttons.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="sizing" />

### Spacing

Use for padding, margins, and position coordinates.

For closely related elements in the same component, such as title and tab line, use `xsmall`.

For linked elements within the same components use `small`, e.g icon and the label. Should be used as main spacing between buttons.

The most common spacing is `medium`, which is used for:

- horizontal and vertical spacing between different cards
- padding inside a card
- space between distinct elements in the same component, e.g. title and progress bar

For components where `medium` is too dense use `large`. Should _never_ be used as a spacing between sections.

For spacing between sections or between components that are _not_ directly linked use `xlarge`.

### Border width

Use to define element border thickness.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="borderWidth" />

### Border radius

Use to define element corner roundness.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="borderRadius" />

### Box shadow

Use to show drop shadow beneath element.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="boxShadow" />

### Font families

For regular text use `sansSerif`, and for code samples `mono`.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="fontFamilies" />

### Font sizes

Use to define font size. For regular text use `medium`.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="fontSizes" />

### Font weights

Use to change how thin or heavy the weight of the font is.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="fontWeights" />

### Letter spacing

Use to adjust the distance between text characters.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="letterSpacing" />

### Line heights

Use to set the distance between lines of text.

For long blocks of text use `relaxed`. For short paragraphs be free to use `default`. For one-liners, such as labels, use `tight`.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="lineHeights" />

### Opacity

Use to change element transparency. For muted colors prefer to use predefined color tokens, over setting the opacity. For disabled elements use `high` opacity.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="opacity" />

### Z-index

Use to set the layering order of the common elements.

<DesignTokensTable tokensGroup="zIndex" />

### Breakpoints

Breakpoints for various device sizes. For **media queries** use [mediaQuery](/components/helpers/#mediaquery) helper or [useMediaQuery](/components/hooks/#usemediaquery) hook.
